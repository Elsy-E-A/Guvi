Objects And Its Internal Representation In Javascript

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

Creating Objects in JavaScript:
1.	By object literal
2.	By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)

By object literal:
The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:
var object={property1:value1,property2:value2,...propertyn:valuen}
 Property and value is separated by colon(:).
Example: var person={name:"elsy",city:"coonoor"}
 

By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):
The syntax of creating object directly is given below:
 var objectname=new Object()
Here, new keyword is used to create object.
Example: var person=new Object();
	 person.name="Elsy"
	 person.city="coonoor"
 
Accessing JavaScript Objects:
The syntax for accessing the property of an object is given below:
objectName.property (or) objectName[“property”]
Accessing using dot operator => person.name
 
Accessing using []=> person["name"]
