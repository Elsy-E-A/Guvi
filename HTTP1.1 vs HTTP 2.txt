HTTP
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a data communications protocol and acts as the foundation of the World Wide Web. Invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in the years 1989–1991. HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server computing model.
HTTP has four versions — HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2.0. Today the version in common use is HTTP/1.1 and the future will be HTTP/2.0.

HTTP 1.1
	The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web.

HTTP 2
	In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created. HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. 

DIFFERENCE

1	Multiplexing	 
In HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded	
In HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.


2	Server push	 
In HTTP/1.1, server only serves content to a client device if the client asks for it.	
In HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client asks for it. The server also sends a message letting the client know what pushed content to expect.

3	Header compression	
In HTTP/1.1, Small files load more quickly than large ones. To speed up web performance, HTTP/1.1 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.	
HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets. This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet. 

4	Prioritization	
In HTTP/1.1, Prioritization refers to the order in which pieces of content are loaded. Prioritization affects a webpage's load time.	
In HTTP/2 offers a feature called weighted prioritization. This allows developers to decide which page resources will load first, every time.
